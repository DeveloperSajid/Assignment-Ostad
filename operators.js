// Assignment-3 : Operator Practice

// Instructions:
// 1. Create a new JavaScript file and save it as "operators.js".
// 2. Write JavaScript code to complete the tasks described below.
// 3. Test your code by running the "operators.js" file in a web browser or using a JavaScript 
// console.

// Tasks:
// 1. Declare two variables called "num1" and "num2" and assign them any numeric values.
// 2. Use the addition operator to calculate the sum of "num1" and "num2". Store the result in a 
// variable called "sum".
// 3. Use the subtraction operator to calculate the difference between "num1" and "num2". Store 
// the result in a variable called "difference".
// 4. Use the multiplication operator to calculate the product of "num1" and "num2". Store the 
// result in a variable called "product".
// 5. Use the division operator to calculate the quotient of "num1" divided by "num2". Store the 
// result in a variable called "quotient".
// 6. Use the modulus operator to calculate the remainder when "num1" is divided by "num2". 
// Store the result in a variable called "remainder".
// 7. Print the following information using console.log():
//  - The sum of num1 and num2: "The sum is [sum]."
//  - The difference between num1 and num2: "The difference is [difference]."
//  - The product of num1 and num2: "The product is [product]."
//  - The quotient of num1 divided by num2: "The quotient is [quotient]."
//  - The remainder when num1 is divided by num2: "The remainder is [remainder]."



 

// Assignment-3 : Operator Practice (Solutions)

// 1. Declare two variables called "num1" and "num2" and assign them any numeric values.
var num1 = 10;
var num2 = 5;

// 2. Use the addition operator to calculate the sum of "num1" and "num2". Store the result in a variable called "sum".
var sum = num1 + num2;

// 3. Use the subtraction operator to calculate the difference between "num1" and "num2". Store the result in a variable called "difference".
var difference = num1 - num2;

// 4. Use the multiplication operator to calculate the product of "num1" and "num2". Store the result in a variable called "product".
var product = num1 * num2;

// 5. Use the division operator to calculate the quotient of "num1" divided by "num2". Store the result in a variable called "quotient".
var quotient = num1 / num2;

// 6. Use the modulus operator to calculate the remainder when "num1" is divided by "num2". Store the result in a variable called "remainder".
var remainder = num1 % num2;

// 7. Print the information using console.log():
console.log("The sum is " + sum + ".");
console.log("The difference is " + difference + ".");
console.log("The product is " + product + ".");
console.log("The quotient is " + quotient + ".");
console.log("The remainder is " + remainder + ".");
