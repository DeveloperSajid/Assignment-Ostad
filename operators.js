// Assignment-3 : Operator Practice

/* Instructions:
1. Create a new JavaScript file and save it as "operators.js".
2. Write JavaScript code to complete the tasks described below.
3. Test your code by running the "operators.js" file in a web browser or using a JavaScript 
console. */

/* Tasks:
1. Declare two variables called "num1" and "num2" and assign them any numeric values.
2. Use the addition operator to calculate the sum of "num1" and "num2". Store the result in a 
variable called "sum".
3. Use the subtraction operator to calculate the difference between "num1" and "num2". Store 
the result in a variable called "difference".
4. Use the multiplication operator to calculate the product of "num1" and "num2". Store the 
result in a variable called "product".
5. Use the division operator to calculate the quotient of "num1" divided by "num2". Store the 
result in a variable called "quotient".
6. Use the modulus operator to calculate the remainder when "num1" is divided by "num2". 
Store the result in a variable called "remainder".
7. Print the following information using console.log():
 - The sum of num1 and num2: "The sum is [sum]."
 - The difference between num1 and num2: "The difference is [difference]."
 - The product of num1 and num2: "The product is [product]."
 - The quotient of num1 divided by num2: "The quotient is [quotient]."
 - The remainder when num1 is divided by num2: "The remainder is [remainder]." */
